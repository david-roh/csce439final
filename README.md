# CSCE 439 Final Project
Efficient intrusion detection on NSL-KDD dataset. Optimizes features, applies dimensionality reduction (PCA, LDA, CFS), and evaluates classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks) to achieve â‰¥90% accuracy across attack types. Includes preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance comparison.
